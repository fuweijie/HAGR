This is the code of the following work:

'Learning on big graph: Label inference and regularization with anchor hierarchy',  IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering. 2017. 

Of note, we use the FLANN package for approximate nearest neighbors searching. You can see http://www.cs.ubc.ca/research/flann/#download and find its implementing detials.
